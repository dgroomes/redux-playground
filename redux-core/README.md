# redux-core

A tic-tac-toe command-line program implemented in Node.js and the core Redux library.

## Description

After browsing the documentation, I'll stick to plain Redux and avoid Redux Toolkit (RTK) for now because I'm
conscientious about the level of abstractness. If I jump straight into the deep end of an ultra abstract tool (like RTK)
instead of wading in carefully (via plain Redux), then I might wind up with an exercise in frustration.

I need a toy program that's concrete enough to balance out the abstractness of Redux but light weight enough that I can
focus on the domain logic and Redux instead of fiddling with incidental things. So, I'll avoid a web app and I'll avoid
TypeScript. I'll write a tic-tac-toe command-line program in JavaScript/Node.js.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to run the tic-tac-toe program:

1. Use Node 18 or later
2. Install Redux:
   * ```shell
     npm install
     ```
3. Run the program:
   * ```shell
     node tic-tac-toe.mjs 
     ```
