## Description

**NOTE**: This project was developed on macOS. It is for my own personal use.

Redux has been a high-popularity library that followed shortly after the trajectory of React's own immense popularity.
I've never learned it. This is mostly because I barely do any JavaScript UI development, but I've also avoided it because
I just don't quite *get it*. As far as software goes, Redux is on the higher side of "abstract software". Today, I'd like
to start my learning journey with Redux.


## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:


## `redux-core/`

A tic-tac-toe command-line program implemented in Node.js and the core Redux library.

See the README in [redux-core/](redux-core/). 

## `redux-toolkit/`

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

An implementation of the classic "Connect Four" game using Redux Toolkit.

See the README in [redux-toolkit/](redux-toolkit/).
