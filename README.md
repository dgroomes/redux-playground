## Description

Redux has been a high-popularity library that followed shortly after the trajectory of React's own immense popularity.
I've never learned it. This is mostly because I barely do any JavaScript UI development, but I've also avoided it because
I just don't quite *get it*. As far as software goes, Redux is on the higher side of "abstract software". Today, I'd like
to start my learning journey with Redux.

After browsing the documentation, I'll stick to plain Redux and avoid Redux Toolkit (RTK) for now because I'm
conscientious about the level of abstractness. If I jump straight into the deep end of an ultra abstract tool (like RTK)
instead of wading in carefully (via plain Redux), then I might wind up with an exercise in frustration.

I need a toy program that's concrete enough to balance out the abstractness of Redux but light weight enough that I can
focus on the domain logic and Redux instead of fiddling with incidental things. So, I'll avoid a web app and I'll avoid
TypeScript. I'll write a tic-tac-toe command-line program in JavaScript/Node.js.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to run the tic-tac-toe program:

1. Use Node 18 or later
2. Install Redux:
   * ```shell
     npm install
     ```
3. Run the program:
   * ```shell
     node tic-tac-toe.mjs 
     ```
