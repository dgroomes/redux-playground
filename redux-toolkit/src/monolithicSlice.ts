I'm not sure I care to "slice up" my Redux stuff into more than one slice because this app is so small. So, somewhat
tongue-in-cheek, I'll name this the "monolithic slice".

Am I supposed to put other functions in this file? Like for example, a "teamOrginalValueToStringValue()" (or more concisely
named) function? Am I meant to jam pure domain code into a Redux construct? Vendor lock-in?
