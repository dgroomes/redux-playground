/*
The 'ConnectFourColumn' element is used as an innocuous wrapper element over the Connect Four circles. It exists
for focusing on the column of spaces while the user is selecting their next move. By "innocuous", I mean that it should
not interfere with the containing CSS grid. Note: I might as well have used flex box, but I want to learn grid. Plus,
I mean a Connect Four board really is a grid, so isn't this an idiomatic use-case?

This takes after the pattern described here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53643295

.ConnectFourColumn {
    display: contents;

.ConnectFourColumn:hover .ConnectFourSpace {
