# redux-toolkit

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

An implementation of the classic "Connect Four" game using Redux Toolkit.

## Description

I want to learn Redux Toolkit, and an effective way to do that is to learn by doing. I think implementing a simple game
in the browser is a good fit for using a state management framework like Redux Toolkit. [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
is a worthy choice for a game. I'll also use TypeScript and TSX because this is what I would choose for a "real" application.
I want to evaluate Redux Toolkit in the context of the other tooling and architecture of a realistic project. Contrast
this project with [`redux-core`](../redux-core/) where I was trying to learn the essence of Redux and I purposely avoided
other concerns.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and serve the app:

1. Install dependencies:
    * ```shell
      npm install
      ```
2. Run the server:
    * ```shell
      npm run dev
      ```
3. Open the browser:
    * <http://127.0.0.1:3000/>
